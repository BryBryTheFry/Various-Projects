# Overview
This is a 3D printed case for an Orange Pi 5 Plus that will run OpenCV and Yolov5.  It needs to be able to have some things such as fans or speakers attached.

# Version 1
This version was the first model, but had various issues once it was printed.
- The board was too small to effectively cover the entire Orange Pi, which meant that the parts meant to hold the fan controller and speaker
- The board lacked a hole for the fan to blow air into
- The screw holes were slightly too small, but could be fixed by drilling them

# Version 2
This was the final model that fixed the issues with the previous version.
- The board was extended to cover most of the board
- A hole was created to allow the fan to blow air onto the board
- The screw holes were expanded slightly
There are a few slight issues, none of which are enough to warrant a reprint
- The fan seal isn't great meaning that some of the air flow is wasted
- Some parts extend farther out than is necessary, such as the speaker area
