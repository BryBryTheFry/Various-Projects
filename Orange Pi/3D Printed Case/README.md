# Overview
This is a 3D printed case for an Orange Pi 5 Plus that will run OpenCV and Yolov5.  It needs to be able to have some things such as fans or speakers attached.
The models were made using Onshape and exported using UltiMaker Cura before being printed on an Ender 3.

# Version 1
### This version was the first model, but had various issues once it was printed.
- The board was too small to effectively cover the entire Orange Pi, which meant that the parts meant to hold the fan controller and speaker
- The board lacked a hole for the fan to blow air into
- The screw holes were slightly too small, but could be fixed by drilling them

# Version 2
### This was the final model that fixed the issues with the previous version.
- The board was extended to cover most of the board
- A hole was created to allow the fan to blow air onto the board
- The screw holes were expanded slightly
### There are a few slight issues, none of which are enough to warrant a reprint
- The fan seal isn't great meaning that some of the air flow is wasted
- Some parts extend farther out than is necessary, such as the speaker area
