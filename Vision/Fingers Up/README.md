# Fingers Up
A project with the goal of using OpenCV to convert which fingers a hand is holding up into numbers. <br>
Note: It does not have the goal of detecting how _many_ fingers are up, as a pinky, index, and thumb doesn't really mean "three"

# Libraries
- Mediapipe in order to detect the hand bones
- OpenCV to use camera
